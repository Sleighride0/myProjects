Bug 1
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
 getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_with_valid_employee_id_returns_list_of_timesheets_for_employee() {
Expected output:
test method should return 2 when given employee ID:1.
Actual output:
test method returned 2
How did you fix this bug?
getTimesheetsByEmployeeId() needed while(results.next) but instead had if which wont work past 1 match.

Bug 2
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
getTimesheetsByProjectId_with_valid_id_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project()
Expected output:
test method should return 3 when given employeeID:1
Actual output:
test method returned 2
How did you fix this bug?
getTimesheetsByProjectId() was set as 'WHERE employee_id' and should be 'WHERE project_id'

Bug 3
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
createTimesheet_creates_timesheet()
Expected output:
 createTimesheet_creates_timesheet() should have timesheet ID of 5
Actual output:
createTimesheet_creates_timesheet() had an error saying timesheet was 0
How did you fix this bug?
createTimesheet() was setting newid as an int but should be a Timesheet object.
Needed to rename the query for object and then use it to set newId with the getTimesheetById() method with newerId as parameter.;

Bug 4
-----
Test that demonstrates problem:
updateTimesheet_updates_timesheet()
Expected output:
updateTimesheet() timesheet test would be accurately updated. Ex. billable was updated to false
Actual output:
updateTimesheet() had an error saying billable was true.
How did you fix this bug?
updateTimesheet() method needed "isBillable = ?" in sql string.  in jdbcTemplate.update also needed timesheet.isBillable.
